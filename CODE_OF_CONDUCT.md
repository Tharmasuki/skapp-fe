# Skapp Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful community, we as contributors, maintainers, and participants of the Skapp project pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.  
We are committed to cultivating an environment where ideas can be shared freely, constructive collaboration is encouraged, and all members feel safe and valued.

## Our Standards

To maintain a positive and productive environment, we expect all participants to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Show respect for differing viewpoints, experiences, and contributions.
- Gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Focus on what benefits the community as a whole.
- Demonstrate empathy and understanding toward others.

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention/advances.
- Trolling, derogatory comments, insults, or personal attacks.
- Harassment in any form, whether public or private.
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., addresses or contact details) without explicit permission.
- Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional environment.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are accountable for:

- Clearly defining and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior.
- Taking fair and appropriate action when standards are breached.

This includes the ability to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that violate the Code of Conduct.
- Temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behavior deemed inappropriate, harmful, or threatening.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- Communication channels (e.g., GitHub, forums, social media, and Slack).
- Project-related events, whether online or in-person.
- Public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Representation may include official email addresses, social media accounts, or serving as a designated Skapp representative at events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Skapp team at hello@skapp.com.

The project team will:

- Review and investigate all reports in a confidential manner.
- Respond appropriately, considering the severity and circumstances of the issue.
- Maintain the confidentiality of reporters.

Failure to adhere to or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith by maintainers may result in consequences determined by the project's leadership.  
Further details of enforcement policies may be provided separately.
